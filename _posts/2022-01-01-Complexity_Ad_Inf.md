Disclaimer: Personal thoughts on theology and the existence of God.

The night sky has always fascinated me. Looking up and seeing thousands of stars with varying colors and luminosity. The radiation from those stars excite the rods in my eyes, converting photons into electrical pulses that are sent to my optic nerve. My brain then processes these signals to formulate an image, of which observable reality emerges. 

Each star tens, hundreds, thousands of light years away. Emitting every wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum and permeating it into space in all directions at the speed limit of the Universe; the speed of light.

I tend to think about the billions of people throughout human history who have seen the same night sky. Some used it as a guide to traverse the seas, others were inspired by it which elicited wonder in the consciousness of humanity as if there is more to reality than what seems. Serving as the conduit of which many philosophies and scientific discoveries were inspired by. 

Observing the Universe is to feel small and helpless in the semblance of the infinite. It speaks to the deepest parts of who we are, to be face to face with the unknown and to reconcile the notion of our own existence relative to our everyday experience.

The physical processes that happen within the universe in passing seem unnoteworthy; phenomena that exist in reality without immediate explanation. It has been described as one large machine constantly working, calculating, and existing, not in the conscious sense, but in the mechanical. In habitual life it may not seem so, nevertheless if you observe closely, begin to analyze, begin to wonder how everything functions around us you quickly realize how wondrously enigmatic it is.

For instance,

Atoms consist of neutrons, protons, and electrons. Molecules are composed of atoms that have different electron configurations which compose the matter around us. The entire universe is filled with matter in these different configurations which gives rise to the periodic table. Electron/Positron charges need to be exactly opposite, graviational forces need to be perfectly balanced relative to the other forces. The Nuclear strong force, weak force, and other "fine structure" constants as well. There is a hierarchy of order that needs to be achieved for matter to manifest.

From the atom to complex chemical structures such as amino acids present on Earth. To DNA structures that constitute biological life, and finally life itself. A consistency of logic from the atom to the definition of complex structures. One of the most complex objects in known existence to us is the human brain.

> def:  Complexity - the state or quality of being intricate or complicated.

One of the most complex objects in known existence to us is the human brain and it is an object of extraordinary complexity. It facilitates movement of the body, choreographs the harmony of our organs, stores an obscene amount of information, and allows us to interface with the reality around us and literally allows thoughts themselves to manifest in a manner that usually positively benefits our existence.

The complexity behind an organ such as the brain, all of the diverse molecular structures that compose it, and all of its different and vast functionalities as fascinating. It literally uses electricity to function, one example of this is calcium/sodium voltage potentials for computational power via axons which are called action potentials. The idea itself that it is studying itself, It’s really extraordinary.

My point being,

From the basic components of reality; atoms, arranged in specific ways result in complex structures that are intelligible to humans. An extreme oversimplification, but that captures the essence of what I’m trying to convey.

Relative to the structure of the universe I tend to view it very closely to the thought process laid out above. At every intersection of this reality there’s complexity. Take a single object and determine what needs to happen for that object to exist and it becomes very complicated very quickly. Complexity is woven into every undertone of this reality.

I exist as a conscious sentient being constituted by various organs that were built by the instructions of molecules that work in concord to perpetuate my existence throughout time.

It’s difficult to bring up the term complexity without mentioning DNA, which is essentially an extraordinarily intricate algorithmic code that constructs life, which is inherent to all of the many variations of life on Earth. DNA orchestrates the construction of life, and determines how to utilize the materials it's given to construct said life.

The existence of life is a bit contrary to the story laid out in the material universe. As I said before, there is a hierarchy of complexity. It seems that life is on top of that hierarchy. Everything else other than life doesn’t have anything close paralleling DNA, which has the ability to propagate information throughout time, and give rise to life that has the potential to comprehend the intelligibility of the universe and directly question it.

Human consciousness ties directly into that and is an entirely different aspect of reality that modern science has really no idea what to do with. The problem with trying to quantify consciousness is because it is incorporeal in nature. Nonetheless it is clearly a result of complexity, whether it emerges because of the computational intelligence of the brain or something more metaphysical in nature, it's evident there are systems at play that are far beyond current humanities understanding. Which starts spelling out the definition of enigmatic very quickly.

Modern science teeters on the edges of metaphysics trying to explain some of what I said above. Scientific epistemologists are wary that their journey will lead towards more philosophical ideas, let alone religious ideas, the irony is this is where science started.

Shifting gears a bit. For life to exist on Earth, there are an absurd amount of processes that need to go correctly without error, for me to even have this thought.

As I write this, I’m being held to the surface of Earth by its gravitational field, which is directly caused by the mass of Earth that is quite literally distorting the 4 dimensionality of space-time itself. Earth is in the gravitational influence of the sun and orbits it at approximentally 30,000 $$\frac{m}{s} $$, with an orbital radius just far away that liquid water can exist which is referred to as the circumstellar habitable zone, or simply the habitable zone.

Earth is currently spinning on its axis at $$23.5$$ degrees allowing for all four seasons to manifest at different orbital periods. The sun is currently bombarding Earth with a stream of high energy particles that could pose a rather massive danger to Earth’s atmosphere. Fortunately, Earth is generating a magnetic field that permeates far into space and deflects these high energy particles by acting as a planetary shield. This is achieved by the conductive nature of Earth’s core and the rotation of it.

The sun is currently traveling around the galactic center of our host galaxy the Milky Way, which happens to be a supermassive black hole; Sagittarius A*. Hundreds of billions of other stars are doing the exact same thing right now in unison.

Hypothetically if you were to get in a spaceship that could reach superluminal speeds and go right outside of the Milky Way galaxy, you’d see the local galactic group Which is a set of galaxies we’re a part of; there are roughly 30 of them. Go outside of that group and you’d see the Virgo Supercluster which has about 2000 galaxies, and yet again, you’d see the Laniakea Supercluster that is home to 100,000 galaxies.

There are trillions of galaxies in the observable universe. Each with billions of stars, statistically each star is host to at least 1 planet, which means there are hundreds of trillions of planets currently orbiting their host stars right now. A star may be collapsing on itself creating a black hole or neutron star as I type this, maybe a star is being born, a solar system forming, the possibilities are endless.

This is just one small piece of the immense incalculable complexities, processes, and systems that are currently existing and interacting in the universe right now.

In my chemistry and physics classes I was always fascinated that the universe is as intelligible as it is, specifically that there are constants that exist independent of time.
The more exotic numbers that arise in physics are known as the universal constants, which as the name implies are believed to be universal throughout all of the universe and are independent of where you are in spacetime. 

A few of these constants are: 

Gravitational Constant
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
6.67\cdot10^{-11} \ \frac{N\cdot m^{2}}{kg^{2}}\\
\end{alignat}
$$

Speed of Light
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
2.998\cdot 10^{8} \ \frac{m}{s}\\
\end{alignat}
$$

Elementary Charge
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
1.602 \cdot 10^{-19} \ C
\end{alignat}
$$

Fine Structure Constant
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
    \frac{1}{137}
\end{alignat}
$$

There are quantum mechanical properties that are so crucial to the structure of matter that if one value was off the universe simply wouldn’t exist as we know it today. From the initial singularity conditions, expansion rates of spacetime, to the known constants listed above in quantum physics.

Now eventually a question has to be asked. I believe every intellectual inevitably has to answer this question and it serves as the origin point and cornerstone for the formulation of entire worldviews.

> Why is the universe intelligible?

How you answer the question determines your interpretation and interaction with reality. It’s the overarching question that towers over the mountains of science, theology, philosophy and hovers over our everyday existence.

There are those that demand the universe and its complexity are the resultant of naturalistic processes that have happened throughout billions of years, and yet others say complexity and intelligibility demand an intelligent designer.

However, if it is evident that the universe has been designed, the idea of a superintelligence that created it becomes more than just a scientific question but a question regarding the fundamental being of humanity itself and maybe, appealing to our humanity, the thought of it being true rattles the foundation of entire lives, ideas, and presuppositions about reality.

At its core, science is concerned with determining truth. Taking a set of ideas that may infer the existence of a phenomena. I would argue that the same method should be applied to the sigma sum of all scientific intelligibility discovered within the universe and try to infer the origins of it, and then postulate if intelligent design is a probable cause for it.

We live in a universe abundant in the unknown, abounding in potentiality and complexity. It’s extremely fascinating, and that’s why I wrote this article which took quite a bit of time to write!

I write these articles to ponder and determine truth, to divide a set of ideas into another and find a common theme. To toy and angle with ideas, sift through them and see what falls out. Repeating the process until I climb the mountain of understanding only to fall back into the depth of ignorance once again. I wouldn’t have it any other way. For me, existence necessitates understanding. 

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Below are some questions I thought of while writing this article, which I’m mostly leaving these here for myself to come back to later. 

Obvious metaphysical ideas can be derived from this, is it illogical to hypothesize if constants were off by a margin life wouldn’t exist? Since we live in a universe where they are what they are?

Is it because there is a multiverse, where each universe has different constants and the one we’re in just so happens to have all the correct variables in place? Multiverse theory just seems like a way to “escape” the question of why the universe is the way it is. Such as to say that the physical models that explain the universe would eventually work in a universe (ours) given an infinite amount of universes.

If this is the case, it seems that the “finely tuned universe” theories would become irrelevant since we’re just in a universe that just so happens to have the quantum mechanical constants needed.

Are we in a simulated Universe designed by an intelligent species? If so, what is base reality?

This hasn’t really resonated with me for the simple reason of how did the simulators come to be? And what would be base reality? It just seems like a way of delaying the overarching question. N + 1 as it were. Eventually you’d have to confront the same question of why does anything exist at all.

Is humanity's ability to reason and articulate our surroundings just a product of millions of years of the mechanisms of evolutionary theory serving as the arbiter of life? Can the complexities of DNA evolve against the second law of thermodynamics over billions of years? If Humanity is truly a product of evolution, why subscribe to morality? 

Where does purpose come from? Humanity's intrinsic drive to persist against the unknown, a sense of responsibility and purpose in relation to evolutionary theory, what are the benefits of this? 

Is it possible for intelligibility to emerge out of randomness? e.g. chance and time equals patterns and functionality? Systems that propagate throughout time, such as DNA? Since it seems DNA is analogous to highly complex mathematical code in biological form. Would it be unreasonable to attribute its existence to an intelligent designer?

To me it seems extremely unlikely for the observed mechanisms in evolution to increase complexity over time eventually resulting in modern day humanity. There needs to be a “will” as it were, subjected to the evolutionary process to guide the organism through the evolutionary stages. If a “will” is projected onto the process, this directly implies an intelligence guiding the process.
