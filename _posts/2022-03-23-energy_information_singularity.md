description: Postulating about where the energy within the universe came from, given that the energy of the universe since its inception has been constant.

Disclaimer: This isn't a scientific article, just my personal thoughts on the origins of the universe.

A few days ago I sat down with my coffee, opened up my computer and started working on my last computer science assignment for the term. I was designing an algorithm to manipulate data input, and turn it into another form. At some point in the meticulous crafting of the algorithm full of if statements and for loops, I realized that I was applying a form of the first law of thermodynamics. 

Given a system, energy cannot be created or destroyed within the system, it can only be altered. In the case of my algorithm the data was never destroyed; I was merely altering it. 

I then thought of how the universe can be modeled as a system, and how the amount of energy within the universe has been fixed since its inception, which immediately leads to the question of where did the energy come from? Of course, I have a subjective answer to this question but I thought it would be fun to go through the algorithmic process of trying to determine the answer. 

I frame this question as a mathematical equation where one side is equal to the other. Information is conserved on both sides of the equation. An input yields an output equal to the input. In this case energy is the input and our universe with all its energy is the output. This is analogous to the first law of thermodynamics which states that energy is always conserved.

Energy in = Energy out

The laws of thermodynamics, which are coincidentally under the umbrella of the laws of physics, are boundary conditions to how anything can operate within the universe. We can apply these laws everywhere with the exception of singularities. Black holes are examples of singularities, which are essentially physical manifestations of division by zero in spacetime where all mathematical meaning breaks down. 

Coincidentally, the ultimate singularity is the initial singularity which is what the universe started from.

This means we have no idea what happened before the universe, only what happens after. i.e when the known laws of physics start working. We know from models of the early universe that everything started from the initial singularity which was much smaller than an atom. An infinite point of density. Which directly implies that everything in existence, everything that anyone will ever see or do within the bounds of the universe started from an infinitesimal point in what would be spacetime.

> All matter, energy, and space was at one time smaller than the width of an atom. 

Every single point of space was at one time at one point, which coincidentally was a time where a point in time wouldn’t be an accurate description because the very concept of “time” or a “point” wouldn’t exist because nothing existed. Every spatial point of the universe was the point where the universe started, it’s just been expanding outward with time. This is called cosmic inflation. 

Little side note. Cosmic inflation is the famous reason why Einstein included a “Cosmological constant” to fix his theory of general relativity. Supposedly his “biggest blunder” turned out to be dark energy.

Now, information is something that can be extrapolated out of an object. For instance, if you measure the mass of an object you will have learned information regarding the mass of said object. In this same way information can be pulled out of neutrons, electrons, photons, etc or really anything.

I bring up information because I think it’s a key point in trying to understand why something exists rather than nothing, and where the energy input came from in the first place.

A thought I had while thinking about the matter contained within the initial singularity is, I realized that the existence of the singularity is information itself and that the singularity contained information. And that the existence of the universe, and the energy within it is information, meaning that an order and intelligibility to the information is needed for me to even articulate it.

> Information: knowledge communicated or received concerning a particular fact or circumstance

For conceptual purposes imagine positive time being the point after the universe came into being and negative as it has yet to begin.

At 0 > t information didn’t exist. I.e nothing existed.
At 0 < t Information started to exist.  I.e something existed.

Information of quantized photons, atomic nuclei, and so forth existed right when the universe came into being, however, the matter itself didn’t just exist, additional information such as *how* These particles were to behave as time went on and were also present.

This information is the manifestation of the laws of physics and the early universe dynamics with itself. Information between point to point particles had to be “communicated” for the universe to exist and inevitably be expanding outward.

More importantly, information on how these particles were to interact with each other was also present. From t = 0 of the universe to now, the same physical and mathematical laws apply.

It’s not just that the universe started to exist. It’s that the universe knew how to behave from that point forward. This directly leads to why the universe is intelligible, because there is information that can be extrapolated out of it, intelligibility leads right into the existence of mathematics and bleeds right into physics and points to something greater. The laws of physics didn’t just “exist” they existed and are directly responsible for the entire basis of the universe’s axiomatic properties.

If you take everything I said above, lay it out and try to reason as to why the universe is the way it is, you really begin to suspect design. Especially when you think of the sheer amount of energy input necessary for it to begin existing, not just the energy, but the components involved in it as well.

Not only was energy input into the universe at its beginning, but information, intelligibility, and physical laws that govern it were input as well. A structure was imposed on it, an order and a way to operate throughout time. Information can be present, but it is wisdom that determines how to apply such information.

The same information that governed the early universe also governs the formation and evolution of stars, planets, solar systems, and galaxies. And ultimately leads to me typing this on a digital device sipping coffee on planet Earth in the Milky Way Galaxy. 

The most fascinating part is that the same laws that the universe abides by are the same laws that are what we, humanity, use and are bound by. The physical laws set within the initial singularity is what allowed life to thrive on Earth. It allows me, a conscious sentient being to exist and to ponder these thoughts. It allows for enormous complexity.

So this is what we know:

The initial singularity started to exist, containing all energy, matter, and space within the universe. It also had information that described how it was to behave throughout time, resulting in galaxies, solar systems, planets, and eventually Earth which houses a sentient species capable of conscious thought and free expression.

Earth is also host to many diverse forms of life, and seems to be the only planet capable of sustaining it. Humanity is now trying to reconcile its existence within the universe that houses it by using its collective cognitive ability which is composed of atomic nuclei that were forged in the cores of dying stars, that are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics that were set at the beginning of the universe. Complexity ad infinitum. 


There are fairly large metaphysical questions that arise from this realization. It’s essentially impossible to try and avoid the question of “How exactly did this all start?”.

There are some that hold the belief that given enough time the universe would simply begin to exist based on the rules of quantum mechanical fluctuations in spacetime. The immediate problem with this is that the premise of it lies on the laws of physics, which before the universe did not exist. At least that we know of.  

So, how did it all begin and where did the energy come from? You inevitably run into the problem of what caused what first. The universe cannot cause itself to exist, as much as my cup of coffee in front of me cannot will itself into existence.

Nothing can come from, well, nothing. This is contrary to some beliefs that try to claim that something can come from nothing. Saying that something can come from nothing actually goes nowhere ontologically; you inevitably end up with the same question. 

For something to begin existing, there needs to be a cause. For the universe to begin existing, there must be a cause. Is causality enough to begin casualty? Or does casualty have an ultimate cause that is uncaused? 

It would seem that the universe has been imbued with knowledge, information; intelligibility. As if someone designed it. Analogous to how an engineer designs a machine to operate, a physicist perfecting a mathematical statement that describes a phenomena, an artist active in the creative process resulting in her magnum opus.

An uncaused cause is actually needed to break out of the infinite recursion of logic to explain what caused the universe. Which leads to the grand reveal. I propose a simple, fitting, yet fairly controversial answer that the universe was in fact created by an intelligent designer. Per the Bible in Genesis 1. 

I’ll explain my reasoning in my next article.
